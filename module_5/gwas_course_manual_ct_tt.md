## What is GWAS?
A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is a study design that scans the whole genome
to find common genetic variants that influence traits or diseases.

**Goals**:
- Identify genetic risk factors for common, complex diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes,
schizophrenia, heart disease) and for quantitative traits (e.g. cholesterol levels).
- Understand biology of disease and find potential therapeutic targets.
- Improve risk prediction and enable personalized or precision medicine, including
pharmacogenetics (e.g. warfarin dosing).

**Key early successes**:
- Complement Factor H variants in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
- Variants in genes affecting warfarin dose and other drug response traits.
